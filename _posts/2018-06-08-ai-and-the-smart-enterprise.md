We, at the Inisght Centre for Data Analytics, organised a seminar to talk about how AI offers tools for data analysis and analytics through natural language understanding, computer vision, machine learning and automated decision making.

The event was a one day seminar in the format of panel discussions with use cases from industry and academic research, followed by a networking lunch with demonstrator presentations.

Speakers were from the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, Genesys, AIB, Garda Síochána, Avaya, Fidelity Investments, and IBM.

My personal work for the conference included: Logo design, graphic design, web design, prepare all printing materials, and organisation.
