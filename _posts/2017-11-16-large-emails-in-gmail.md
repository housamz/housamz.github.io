If your Gmail inbox is starting to run low on space, you may need to find those emails with big attachements hiding in your inbox.

To do that, there are many third-party tools but you can't trust them with your email.  

One easy way to find those messages is to use the Gmail search and search by message size.  
You just type `size:` and then you specify the minimum size that you want the message to be.  
For example, you can write `size:1000` for messages above 1KB, and so on.  
To make this easier, I list below some direct links to search in your inbox:
* [Larger than 5MB - size:5000000](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/size%3A5000000){:target="_blank"}
* [Larger than 10MB - size:10000000](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/size%3A10000000){:target="_blank"}
* [Larger than 25MB - size:25000000](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/size%3A25000000){:target="_blank"}
