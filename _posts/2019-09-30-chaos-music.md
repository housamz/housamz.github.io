I decided to publish some of my music on Youtube, this is my first piece.

The whole theme is about a scene during the war.  
A little girl stands on a street, a missile falls down, chaos all over the place. The music starts to play a lullaby for her to sleep, but then the wide-angle shows hundreds of dead people where no one can count them or tell their names.  
  
For all those who went to sleep and never woke up, good night...  
  
Based on a famous Arab lullaby by Fairouz "[Yalla Tnam Rima](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xb2h-SXAvUE){:target="_blank"}" mixed with a verse of another song "[Ana Andy Haneen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED0Ns2XQ9IM){:target="_blank"}".
