I am planning to start a series about topics that you need to learn in React. These topics are among the trending topics nowadays, and the type of my posts will be introduction to each of the topics. I will continue to update this post with links to keep it as an index to all the posts on the topic.

Alternatively, you can check the (React)[https://www.hmz.ie/tags/#react] tag on my website for a list of all the posts.

The topics list is:

1. (React Hooks)[https://www.hmz.ie/react-hooks]: Hooks are a new addition to React, allowing you to use state and other React features without writing a class component. You could write a blog post on how to use different React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, and `useRef`.

2. React Native: React Native is a popular framework for building mobile apps using React. You could write about how to use React Native to build mobile apps for iOS and Android.

3. React Performance: React provides several performance optimizations, like `shouldComponentUpdate` and React.memo. You could write about how to optimize your React app's performance and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

4. React Server-Side Rendering: Server-side rendering (SSR) is a technique for rendering a React app on the server, rather than in the client's browser. You could write about how to implement SSR in a React app and the benefits it provides.

5. (React Testing)[https://www.hmz.ie/intro-to-react-testing-library/]: Testing is an important part of any software development process. You could write about how to test your React components using tools like Jest and Enzyme.

6. React Redux: Redux is a popular state management library that can be used with React. You could write about how to use Redux with React to manage your app's state.

7. React Next.js: Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React apps. You could write about how to use Next.js to build a production-ready React app.

8. React TypeScript: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides static typing and other features. You could write about how to use TypeScript with React to build type-safe and more maintainable React apps.

9. (React Routing)[https://www.hmz.ie/add-multiple-pages-react/]: Adding multiple pages to your React app to be able to navigate between different pages and copy a direct link to a page.

Thanks!
