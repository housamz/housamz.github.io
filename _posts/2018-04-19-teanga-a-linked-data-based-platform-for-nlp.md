In this presentation, I introduced Teanga to my colleagues in DSI before I travel to Japan to present it in LREC 2018.

Teanga, a linked data based platform for natural language processing (NLP). Teanga enables the use of many NLP services from a single interface, whether the need was to use a single service or multiple services in a pipeline. 

Teanga focuses on the problem of NLP services interoperability by using linked data to define the types of services input and output. 

Teangaâ€™s strengths include being easy to install and run, easy to use, able to run multiple NLP tasks from one interface and helping users to build a pipeline of tasks through a graphical user interface.
