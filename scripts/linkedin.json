    "summary": "I'm a Software Engineer by day, a lecturer by night, and an electronics hobbyist in between â€“ basically, I'm a 24/7 nerd. My journey into the tech world started back in '98 when I was just a wide-eyed Web Designer, but let's be honest, who wasn't in '98? Fast forward to 2008, and I made the genius decision to dive headfirst into Web Development. It was like going from playing with LEGO to building the actual skyscraper! ðŸŽ¨ ðŸ’» âœ¨\n\nAlong the way, I soaked up more knowledge than a sponge at a TED talk. I'm talking Business Development, Marketing, Management â€“ you name it! I even dabbled in Entrepreneurship, but don't ask me about the failed lemonade stand. Oh, and I've been rubbing digital elbows with international organisations, no big deal.\n\nNow, my true calling? Making stuff look good! I'm passionate about crafting designs that are so drop-dead gorgeous they make the Mona Lisa look like a doodle on a napkin. Whether it's for print or the web, I'm on a quest for happyness, one pixel at a time.",

Teanga focuses on the problem of NLP services interoperability by using linked data to define the types of services input and output. Teangaâ€™s strengths include being easy to install and run, easy to use, able to run multiple NLP tasks from one interface and helping users to build a pipeline of tasks through a graphical user interface.",

However, to date, adding these functionalities was a tedious, costly, and time-consuming effort, requiring identification and integration of diverse tools with diverse interfaces as required by the use case at hand. The MixedEmotions Toolbox leverages the need for such functionalities by providing tools for text, audio, video, and linked data processing within an easily integrable plug-and-play platform. These functionalities include: 1) for text processing: emotion and sentiment recognition; 2) for audio processing: emotion, age, and gender recognition; 3) for video processing: face detection and tracking, emotion recognition, facial â€¦",

For this reason, we present OTTO, an OnTology TranslatiOn System, which enhances ontologies with multilingual information. Rather a different task than the classic document translation, ontology label translation faces highly specific vocabulary and lack contextual information. Therefore, OTTO takes advantage of the semantic information of the ontology to improve the translation of labels.",

It gives a ranked lists of related entities to a given entity, and clusters them using the different filters. For instance, using EnRG, one can easily find the American vegans related to Brad Pitt or Irish universities related to Semantic Web. Moreover, EnRG helps a user in discovering the provenance for implicit relations between two entities. EnRG uses distributional semantics to obtain the relatedness scores between two entities.",

      "reference": "I had the privilege of being under the tutelage of Housam Ziad in the subject of Artificial Intelligence during my university studies. For an intense period of 8 weeks, he expanded my knowledge and understanding of AI, immersing me in an environment that was both challenging and nurturing.\n\nHousam is an exceptional educator and a skilled software engineer. His depth and breadth of knowledge in AI were immediately apparent. He exhibits an impressive ability to clarify complex concepts, breaking them down into easily digestible components. He seamlessly merged theory with practice, introducing us to real-world applications of AI, which further strengthened my understanding of the subject.\n\nIn addition, his skills as a software engineer shone through in the curriculum. He consistently emphasised on the importance of both the conceptual and technical aspects of AI, providing comprehensive insights into the engineering principles and practices behind the technology.\n\nBut what set Housam apart is not only his technical acumen but also his dedication to teaching and his approachability. He created an engaging and inclusive classroom environment, readily available for discussions, feedback, and support. His passion for AI was infectious, and it was clear that his goal was not just to disseminate knowledge, but also to inspire curiosity and innovation in his students.\n\nAs a result of his guidance, I feel better prepared for the challenges and opportunities that the field of AI offers. I am confident in saying that my time under his supervision has been instrumental in my academic growth.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Housam as an outstanding educator and a profound expert in AI and software engineering. His ability to inspire and educate makes him an invaluable asset to any institution."
